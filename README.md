# Basics

Implementations in this repo are most definitely not the best ones. But they should be simple and good enough to understand the reason why these things are used.

### Sequence (ADT)

All modern languages allow you to store items in a sequential structure and get them by index. And they're not force you to think about its size, reallocations and so on.
There is a good explanation in [the MIT lecture](https://youtu.be/CHhwJjR0mZA?si=HczOKCTEwWgjlTbG). [My implementation in C](./sequence.c).

### Sorting

* [Merge sort](./merge_sort.c) ([a MIT lecture](https://youtu.be/oS9aPzUNG-s?si=8tF4PDGuiyS0Uq-b))
