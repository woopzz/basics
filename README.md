# Basics

The modern programming languages, platforms, frameworks are amazing. And there are lots of things I use ever day, but don't really know how they work. In this repo I want to implement some basic data structures / algorithms / programming concepts / tricks to understand them better. What I cannot create, I do not understand.

The implementations are most surely not perfect. I don't have a purpose to make them this way. I want to understand ideas that make a particular concept useful and I leave other details as simple as possible.

### Dynamic array

- [2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays. MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Spring 2020](https://youtu.be/CHhwJjR0mZA?si=HczOKCTEwWgjlTbG)

[My implementation in C.](./sequence.c) I call the structure "Sequence" as an implementation of the ADT Sequence from the MIT lecture.

### Hash table

- [Hash Tables Playlist. WilliamFiset.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDH5Wq-Vk5tDb8gH03cULZS&si=qkRr_bu5co1CoVA9)
- [A better hash table (in C). Jacob Sorber.](https://youtu.be/KI_V91UdL1I?si=WshHTSeFb21RoUno)
- [Several hash functions implementations in C.](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html)
- [Max Slater's blog post](https://thenumb.at/Hashtables)

[My implementation in C. Linear probing. Backward-shift deletion.](./hashtable.c)

### Heap

- [Abdul Bari's video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/HqPJF2L5h9U?si=WyCA6gmRTKTjLxZg) <<< this video is brilliant btw

[My implementation in C.](./heap.c)

### Sorting

- [Merge sort](./merge_sort.c)
