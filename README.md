# Basics

The modern programming languages, platforms, frameworks are amazing. And there are lots of things I use ever day, but don't really know how they work. In this repo I want to implement some basic data structures / algorithms / programming concepts / tricks to understand them better. What I cannot create, I do not understand.

The implementations are most surely not perfect. I don't have a purpose to make them this way. I want to understand ideas that make a particular concept useful and I leave other details as simple as possible.

### Dynamic array

[sequence.c](./sequence.c)

### Hash table

[hashtable.c (linear probing, backward-shift deletion)](./hashtable.c)

### Heap

[heap.c](./heap.c)

All I needed was [Abdul Bari's video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/HqPJF2L5h9U?si=WyCA6gmRTKTjLxZg). This video is a gem!

### Merge sort

[merge_sort.c](./merge_sort.c)
